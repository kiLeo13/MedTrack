## ðŸ¤” What is MedTrack?
MedTrack is a simple Arduino-based robot (Arduino Uno) written in C++ that periodically reminds users to take their medication on time.

## ðŸ“š Why MedTrack?
This project was initially created as an assignment for our Computer Science course, under the guidance of Professor Renato Rocha.  
The task was to build a robot, with no specific theme restrictions â€” we chose to create a "Medicine Tracker" to make a real difference in users' lives by helping them manage their medication schedules more effectively.
